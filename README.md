# Brakeman for Ruby LSP

This library enables running [Brakeman](https://brakemanscanner.org/) via [Ruby LSP](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/).

The library is in early but working stages. It has only been tested with VS Code so far.

## Installation

Add `ruby-lsp-brakeman` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-lsp-brakeman', require: false
```

Bundle install and restart the Ruby LSP server/extension to enable.

## In Action

Initialization output should look like this:

Display of inline warnings on hover:

Display after clicking "View Problem":

Warnings are listed as "problems" in VS Code's panel:

When files are saved, Brakeman will rescan the files and update any impacted warnings.
Note that scans are asynchronous and only one scan will run at a time. If multiple files are changed while a scan is running, they will be queued and then rescanned all together when the current scan finishes.

## Limitations

* Column numbers are not available right now, so the entire line is always reported
* Brakeman's rescanning capabilities are currently being overhauled. They work but may be a little slow (but still faster than a full scan)
* Large applications may require way too much memory for incremental scans to be useful
* Warnings may not clear if Ruby LSP crashes
* VS Code does not seem to support `CodeDescription` which can link to more information
* No tests yet, so buyer beware
